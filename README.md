# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on key health indicators such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, and ECG results. Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost, the model analyzes historical medical data to identify patterns associated with heart conditions. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and improve patient outcomes through data-driven insights.
